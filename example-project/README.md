# Example project

This is a project example. Instead of the composer related files and everythingh, it just needs the custom code in the
modules folder and the exported config in config folder.

To build the full project use the taas build command. IN this playground project, just call

    ../taas-cli/taas build

This will create docroot and vendor within the build directory and creates symlinks for custom modules and config.
